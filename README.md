## Horiseon SEO homepage

I edited the HTML and CSS code to include semantic elements and put them in a logical structure.  I also added alt tags to the images for accessability purposes.  In addition, I updated the title element.

My goal was to add these changes to make the code more visually appealing while maintaining the integrity of Horiseon's homepage.

Overall this keeps the hompage the same but it cleans up the HTML and CSS code so it can be easier to disect the individual elements.  This will make it easier in the future to add enhancements and other features to this code.

Overall, this was a great learning experience to show me that there are many ways to write a code and get the same outcome but using semantic element tags and alt tags can make updating and editing these files significantly more smooth.
